# AI-and-Machine-Learning
I collaberated with a classmate and good friend of mine, Herschel Darko.
The code is mostly based on the templates given within the textbook: "Artificial Intelligence: A Mordern Approach 3rd edition" which was our main textbook for the course.

The path-finding script will run all of the functions at the same time and show the shortest path to the prizes depending on the path-finding algorithm.
The path-finding algorithms are: DFS, BFS, GBFS, and ASTAR.

To use the path-finding script, simply call it and insert one the text file prizes in the prompt. It does take a while for the AI to find the prizes for certain maps given then some of the algorithms are not optimized for it.

To use the decision tree script, call the script and use the "decisiontree_pets.txt" file, "decisiontree_titanic.txt", or the "decisiontree_tennis.txt" files.
